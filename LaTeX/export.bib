	publisher={IEEE},
	pages={1-20},
	abstract={A wind tunnel test of the Adaptable Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) was conducted in April 2015 at the US Army&#39;s 7×10 Foot Wind Tunnel located at NASA Ames Research Center. Key geometric features of the fabric test article were a 0.7 m deployed base diameter, a 70° half-angle forebody cone angle, eight ribs, and a nose-to-base radius ratio of 0.7. The primary objective of this wind tunnel test was to obtain static deflected shape and pressure distributions while varying pretension at dynamic pressures and angles of attack relevant to entry conditions at Earth, Mars, and Venus. Other objectives included obtaining aerodynamic force and moment data and determining the presence and magnitude of any dynamic aeroelastic behavior (buzz/flutter) in the fabric trailing edge. All instrumentation systems worked as planned and a rich data set was obtained. This paper describes the test articles, instrumentation systems, data products, and test results. Four notable conclusions are drawn. First, test data support adopting a pre-tension lower bound of 10 lbf/in for Nano-ADEPT mission applications. Second, test results indicate that the fabric conditioning process needs to be reevaluated. Third, no flutter/buzz of the fabric was observed for any test condition and should also not occur at hypersonic speeds. Fourth, translating one of the gores caused ADEPT to generate lift without the need for a center of gravity offset. At hypersonic speeds, the lift generated by actuating ADEPT gores could be used for vehicle control.},

	note={ID: $cdi\_ieee\_primary\_6497412$},
	abstract={Future space missions will require improvements in the Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) phases of the mission architecture. The focus of this paper is to discuss recent advances in analysis, fabrication techniques, ground testing, and flight testing of a stacked torus Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) and its application to the future of EDL. The primary structure of a stacked torus HIAD consists of nested inflatable tori of increasing major diameter bonded and strapped to form a rigid structure after inflation. The underlying structure of the decelerator is covered with a flexible Thermal Protection System (TPS) capable of high heat flux. The inflatable aeroshell and TPS are packed around a centerbody within the launch fairing and deployed prior to atmospheric reentry. Recent fabrication of multiple HIADs between 3 and 6 meters has led to significant advances in process control and validation of the scalability of the technology. Progress has been made in generating and validating LS-DYNA FEA models to replicate flight loading in addition to analytical models of substructures. Coupon and component testing has improved the validation of modeling techniques and assumptions at the subsystem level. A ground testing campaign at the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Center (NFAC) wind tunnel at NASA Ames Research center generated substantial aerodynamic and loading data to validate full system modeling with comparable dynamic pressures to a hypersonic reentry. The Inflatable Reentry Vehicle - 3 (IRVE-3) sounding rocket flight test was conducted with NASA Langley Research Center in July 2012. The IRVE-3 mission verified the structural and thermal performance of the stacked torus configuration. Further development of the stacked torus configuration is currently being conducted to increase the thermal capability, deceleration loads, and understanding of the interactions and effects of constituent components. The results of this research have expanded the feasible flight envelope of stacked torus HIAD designs over a range of sizes, loading conditions, and heating.},

	address={Hampton},
	abstract={Current NASA Human Mars architectures require delivery of approximately 20 metric tons of cargo to the surface in a single landing. A proposed vehicle type for performing the entry, descent, and landing at Mars associated with this architecture is a rigid, enclosed, elongated lifting body shape that provides a higher lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) than a typical entry capsule, but lower than a typical winged entry vehicle (such as the Space Shuttle Orbiter). A rigid Mid-L/D shape has advantages for large mass Mars EDL, including loads management, range capability during entry, and human spaceflight heritage. Previous large mass Mars studies have focused more on symmetric and/or circular cross-section Mid-L/D shapes such as the ellipsled. More recent work has shown performance advantages for non-circular cross section shapes. This paper will describe efforts to design a rigid Mid-L/D entry vehicle for Mars which shows mass and performance improvements over previous Mid-L/D studies. The proposed concept, work to date and evolution, forward path, and suggested future strategy are described.}

	abstract={A novel rigid deployable aeroshell architecture has been developed, where rigid panels with a thermal protection system layer are connected between retractable ribs. Following origami principles, an optimal fold pattern is selected and imposed on the panels to ensure efficient flat stowage during launch and repeatable deployment. The design process includes minimizing the number of folds to reduce stacking height and maximizing the angles between each fold line to avoid an unfavorable aerothermodynamic response. The dynamic behavior of the optimal design is analyzed with the aid of a dynamic multibody analysis model. Results from the dynamic model show that the process of deployment is highly sensitive to panel geometry (especially panel thickness and hinge design). Robust, repeatable, and controllable deployment is most readily achieved with a small (but nonzero) panel thickness and selection of interpanel hinges, which allow a degree of over-rotation, avoiding a premature hard stop, which would otherwise prevent full deployment. Modeled results have been verified through experimental testing of a 0.4-m-diam scale model.},

	abstract={Cost is one of the biggest obstacles to sending humans to Mars. However, spacecraft costs are typically not taken into consideration until after the preliminary vehicle and mission concepts have been designed. Once costs have been estimated, managers and project teams often lack confidence that the final cost of the mission will match the preliminary estimates. The present work provides a robust methodology for using cost as a valid metric early in the design phase of future human Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) vehicles. This is done in three parts. First, state of the art parametric costing methods are applied to three Mars EDL vehicle concepts. Second, a methodology is presented which advances the state of the art in estimating the cost of space vehicles, specifically those used for EDL. This is done by automating portions of the cost estimation process, and integrating parametric cost tools with other systems analysis tools so that the effect of any change in vehicle or mission design on the mission cost can be determined more efficiently. Finally two of the primary parametric cost estimating tools used at NASA and in industry are tested in a blind validation study. To date, no such validation study has been published in the literature. In addition, standard parametric cost estimating methodologies and assumptions are compared with historical data and are modified to improve predictive capabilities.},

	abstract={This study explores the aerothermal behaviour of a rigid mechanically deployable aeroshell developed at Imperial College London for high-payload atmospheric entry missions. The multiphysics CFD software STAR-CCM+ is used to perform a Conjugate Heat Transfer analysis on the aeroshell’s faceted geometry. Results are presented for four different geometry models tested in air at Mach 5 with angles of attack α = 0°, 5° and 10°. The predicted surface heat transfer reveals areas of elevated heat loads at the ribs between facets and at the aeroshell shoulder, due to local boundary layer thinning. The increase in heat transfer at the ribs depends on the sharpness of the rib: more rounded shapes result in lower heat fluxes. Comparison with high-speed wind tunnel tests shows good agreement with experimental data. Stanton number and temperature profiles agree within 8\% and 2\% respectively. The discrepancies between experiments and simulations are largest at the sharp ribs of the aeroshell. The sources of error can be associated to three dimensional effects neglected in the heat flux derivations from temperature measurements as well as experimental uncertaintes.}

In the intervening 25 years, DSMC has become the method of choice for modeling rarefied gas dynamics in a variety of scenarios. The chief barrier to applying DSMC to more dense or even continuum flows is its computational expense compared to continuum computational fluid dynamics methods. The dramatic (nearly billion-fold) increase in speed of the largest supercomputers over the last 30 years has thus been a key enabling factor in using DSMC to model a richer variety of flows, due to the method’s inherent parallelism. We have developed the open-source SPARTA DSMC code with the goal of running DSMC efficiently on the largest machines, both current and future. It is largely an implementation of Bird’s 1994 formulation. Here, we describe algorithms used in SPARTA to enable DSMC to operate in parallel at the scale of many billions of particles or grid cells, or with billions of surface elements. We give a few examples of the kinds of fundamental physics questions and engineering applications that DSMC can address at these scales.},

This release of the code includes many features not found in standard dsmcFoam, such as molecular vibrational and electronic energy modes, chemical reactions, and subsonic pressure boundary conditions. Since dsmcFoam+ is designed entirely within OpenFOAM’s C++ object-oriented framework, it benefits from a number of key features: the code emphasises extensibility and flexibility so it is aimed first and foremost as a research tool for DSMC, allowing new models and test cases to be developed and tested rapidly. All DSMC cases are as straightforward as setting up any standard OpenFOAM case, as dsmcFoam+ relies upon the standard OpenFOAM dictionary based directory structure. This ensures that useful pre- and post-processing capabilities provided by OpenFOAM remain available even though the fully Lagrangian nature of a DSMC simulation is not typical of most OpenFOAM applications. We show that dsmcFoam+ compares well to other well-known DSMC codes and to analytical solutions in terms of benchmark results.

	pages={75-88},
	abstract={In order to improve predictions of the on-ground casualty risk associated with the uncontrolled atmospheric re-entry of satellites from Low Earth Orbit, there is significant research interest in the development of engineering models of hypersonic heating rates to faceted shapes. A key part of developing such models is generating accurate datasets of the heat fluxes experienced by faceted shapes at various orientations in hypersonic flows. In this work, we use wind tunnel experiments and CFD simulations to study the hypersonic flow around a cuboid geometry at 5° incidence in a Mach 5 flow at Reynolds numbers of 79.5×103, 109×103 and 148×103. The wind tunnel data are obtained in the University of Manchester's High SuperSonic Tunnel and consist of schlieren images and temperature histories collected using infrared thermography. These temperature histories are used to calculate experimental heat fluxes by solving a three-dimensional inverse heat conduction problem. CFD simulations around the same geometry at equivalent free-stream conditions are calculated with the DLR-TAU code. The experimental and CFD results show good agreement both in terms of heat fluxes as well as flow structure. Notable flow structures include wedge-shaped regions of high heat flux which emanate from the windward corners of the cube. Analysis of numerical Q-criterion contours show that these high heat flux regions are caused by vortex structures generated by the expansion at the cube corner. Analysis of the numerical skin friction coefficient shows that even at incidence there is no breakaway separation from the expansion edges of the cube and the flow remains attached throughout. We show that although there is little change in the average heat flux experienced by a cube at 5° incidence to the free-stream compared to one at 0° incidence, there are significant changes in the heat flux contours over the cubes at these two incidences. Finally, we calculate a number of heating shape factors which can easily be implemented in satellite re-entry and demise prediction analysis tools.
•Experimental measurements of the heat flux to a cube generally agree well with CFD.•However, agreement is poor at sharp corners and edges.•The addition of small angles of incidence does not significantly affect average heating rates.•Expansions around 3D corners can generate vortex structures which significantly increase heating.},

New criterion for the number of model particles is proposed, invariant on local density and, in simplest case, coming to product of the mean number of particles in a cell and the number of cells along the local mean free path. First order convergence on the criterion value is demonstrated for both 1D and 2D grids.},

	pages={1-9},
	abstract={The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method models fluid flows using simulation particles which represent a large number of real molecules in a probabilistic simulation to solve the Boltzmann equation. Different opinions still exist on some basic understandings of the controlling factors of DSMC method, such as the proper grid dimension and the proper number of particles in a cell. In this contribution, DSMC simulation of Poiseuille flow was carried out to evaluate the dependence of simulation results on cell dimension and number of particles per cell. In the simulation process a self-adaptive block-structured grid system was employed to guarantee that the number of particles per cell is constant. The simulation covers both 2D and 3D, slip flow regime and transition flow regime, and for each regime, covers both high pressure and low pressure cases. Our simulation results indicate that the number of particles per cell and scaling factor have little influence on simulation result for both slip flow and transition flow when the number of particles per cell is greater than 5, but the dimension of cell influences the accuracy of results significantly. The error caused by cell dimension decreases with the decrease of cell dimension.

	title={Direct Simulation Monte Carlo for Atmospheric Entry. 1. Theoretical Basis and Physical Models},
	abstract={The direct simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) has evolved over 40 years into a powerful numerical technique for the computation of complex, nonequilibrium gas flows. In this context, nonequilibrium means that the velocity distribution function is not in an equilibrium form due to a low number of intermolecular collisions within a fluid element. In atmospheric entry, nonequilibrium conditions occur at high altitude and in regions of flow fields with small length scales. In this first article of two parts, the theoretical basis of the DSMC technique is discussed. In addition, the methods used in DSMC are described for simulation of high temperature, real gas effects and gas-surface interactions. The current status of the various models is reviewed and areas where further work is required are identified.

abstract = {The present work provided a numerical investigation of the supersonic flow of rarefied gas into a planar micronozzle characterized by small depth and long divergent section. 2D and 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computations were performed using the continuum Navier-Stokes equations in combination with partial slip conditions at walls, based on a the establishment of the slip regime related to a Knudsen number ranging between 1 x 10-3 and 1 x 10-1. Different partial slip conditions were considered, i.e. the ideal case of pure slip conditions and the full viscous case with Maxwellian slip conditions on sidewalls and planar walls, as well as the case of Maxwellian slip just on sidewalls. The Maxwell slip model was set with a tangential accommodation coefficient equal (TMAC) to 0.8. Comparisons were based on the estimation of the global performance of the micronozzle in terms of thrust force, specific impulse, discharge coefficient and Isp-efficiency. It resulted that when the nozzle depth was neglected, 3D simulations led to the same solution obtained by means of 2D computations inside the micronozzle. The boundary layer thicknesses experienced a linear growth on the sidewalls, and the viscous losses produced a reduction of the performance of about the 95\%. Significant differences were found in the prediction of the jet plume, which took the typical bell-shape form in cases involving 2D computations, yet 3D simulations estimated a plume characterized by the succession of oblique shock waves and expansion fan waves. Instead, when the nozzle depth was considered, 3D simulations underlined a completely different behavior of the flow because of the establishment of the nozzle blockage and a viscous heating. The performance suffered an intense degradation of about the 47\%, and the analysis of the jet plume highlighted the formation of the Mach disk followed by the typical diamond-shaped subsonic recirculation region.}

ABSTRACT = {The effect of the Knudsen layer in the thermal micro-scale gas flows has been investigated. The effective mean free path model has been implemented in the open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, to extend its applicability up to slip and early transition flow regime. The conventional Navier-Stokes constitutive relations and the first-order non-equilibrium boundary conditions are modified based on the effective mean free path, which depends on the distance from the solid surface. The predictive capability of the standard &lsquo;Maxwell velocity slip&mdash;Smoluchwoski temperature jump&rsquo; and hybrid boundary conditions &lsquo;Langmuir Maxwell velocity slip&mdash;Langmuir Smoluchwoski temperature jump&rsquo; in conjunction with the Knudsen layer formulation has been evaluated in the present work. Simulations are carried out over a nano-/micro-scale backward facing step geometry in which flow experiences adverse pressure gradient, separation and re-attachment. Results are validated against the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) data, and have shown significant improvement over the existing CFD solvers. Non-equilibrium effects on the velocity and temperature of gas on the surface of the backward facing step channel are studied by varying the flow Knudsen number, inlet flow temperature, and wall temperature. Results show that the modified solver with hybrid Langmuir based boundary conditions gives the best predictions when the Knudsen layer is incorporated, and the standard Maxwell-Smoluchowski can accurately capture momentum and the thermal Knudsen layer when the temperature of the wall is higher than the fluid flow.},

abstract = {AbstractA numerical investigation of Knudsen layer effects in high-speed flows in a rarefied flow regime has been carried out. The conventional compressible flow computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver is reformed based on the effective mean free path model to augment the validity of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations in the slip-transition flow regime. The mean free path is expressed as a function of the distance from the surface and local flow gradients, and has been used to modify linear constitutive relations, as well as slip and jump boundary conditions, to incorporate Knudsen layer correction. The improved solver has been validated against direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) data of benchmark test cases of hypersonic flow (Mach number=6.1 and 12.7) over a flat plate in the slip-flow regime (Knudsen number=0.004), and Mach 10 flow over a circular cylinder in the transition flow regime (Knudsen number=0.25). The results show that the accuracy of the conventional CFD solver has been significantly improved due to the implementation of the Knudsen layer approach in the near-wall region and the bulk-flow region. Crucial nonlinear trends are captured in the nonequilibrium regions of high-speed flows, such as shock waves and the Knudsen layer. The location of an oblique shock around the flat plate is accurately captured and overall, the Knudsen layer incorporation has exhibited good agreement with the DSMC with deviations within 4\% in the upstream region of the cylinder.},

abstract = {The cavity configurations produced by discontinuities at thermal protection system coated at surface of reentry space vehicles can lead to separation, attachment, and even transition of gas flows around the vehicle's surface, which can bring serious aerodynamic heating during the space vehicles reentering the Earth's atmosphere. In this paper, the continuum, slip, and transition flow regimes are chosen to represent reentry atmosphere environment and then a numerical investigation of hypersonic gas flows over a family of cavities is performed by using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method to reveal flow structures in the cavity flowfield under different length-to-depth ratios and freestream incoming Mach numbers. In particular, when the freestream varies from the continuum to the transition flow regimes, the minimal length-to-depth ratios required for cavity flow becoming the closed type are 8, 6, and 5, respectively. The effect of the freestream incoming Mach number on the cavity flow characteristics is getting weaker when the freestream varies from the continuum to the transition flow regime. The two significant findings are that the cavity flow characteristics under hypersonic conditions are primarily determined by cavity geometry rather than freestream incoming Mach number and secondly, effect of the freestream incoming Mach number on cavity flow type is very slight if the freestream is in the transition flow regime.}

The effects of the rounded separation/reattachment corner on flow characteristics are discussed. The sensitivities of aerodynamic surface quantities are hence assessed comprehensively. Flows over the cavity configurations specified in the study hold the “open-cavity” characteristics and do not show any unsteadiness. The rounded separation corner does not significantly alter the flow patterns, while the rounded reattachment corner has a remarkable effect. Rounding the separation and reattachment corners can weaken the baroclinic effect in the separation and reattachment regions, respectively. For the rounded separation corner, it is easier for external gas molecules to enter the cavity and hence promote the momentum and energy exchanges with gas molecules inside the cavity. The fluid density inside the cavity, peak density at the reattachment point, pressure on and heat fluxes to the cavity floor are augmented, compared to those in the rectangular cavity case. However, the rounded reattachment corner may enhance the escape of gas molecules from the cavity and weaken the exchanges of momentum and energy. This leads to a significant decrease in the gas density inside the cavity, peak gas density at the reattachment point, pressure on and heat fluxes to the cavity floor. It is concluded that the approach of rounding the reattachment corner can achieve the most dramatic drop in the peak pressure and heat flux at the reattachment point. The research is guidable to the aerodynamic design of local configuration of hypersonic vehicles.}

abstract = { Rarefied gas flow over a backward-facing step (BFS) is often encountered in separating flows prevalent in aerodynamic flows, engine flows, condensers, space vehicles, heat transfer systems, and microflows. Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) is a powerful tool to investigate such flows. The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of Mach number and wall temperature on the flow and surface properties in the transitional flow regime. The Mach numbers considered are 5, 10, 25, 30, and the ratio of the temperature of the wall to that of freestream considered are 1, 2, 4, 8. The Reynolds number for the cases studied is 8.6, 17.2, 43, and 51.7, respectively. Typically the flow properties near the wall are found to increase with both Mach number and wall temperature owing to compressibility and viscous dissipation effects. The variation in flow properties is more sensitive to Mach number than the wall temperature. The surface properties are found to decrease with Mach number and increase with wall temperature. Moreover, in the wake of the step, the vortex’s recirculation length is reasonably independent of both free stream Mach number and wall temperature, whereas it decreases with Knudsen number. }

abstract = {A Forward-Facing Step (FFS) can be approximated as a simplified geometry for modeling the irregularities around space vehicles, the flow around which is often rarefied. These irregularities lead to flow separation, circulation, and re-attachment. This study aims to examine one of the fundamental surface irregularities that can have a significant effect on the design of space vehicles. In this article, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), an effective method for studying rarefied flows, is used to investigate the role of rarefaction on the non-reacting hypersonic rarefied gas flow over a forward-facing step. A comprehensive analysis of the effects of Knudsen number on the on flow-field properties, i.e., velocity, pressure, temperature, density, and surface properties, i.e., pressure coefficient, skin friction coefficient, and heat transfer coefficient is performed. The selected Knudsen number range from 0.05 to 21.33, covering the various rarefaction regimes. The Mach number of the free-stream flow employed was 25. The sections in the vicinity and downstream of the step are examined in-depth, describing the predominant nonequilibrium aspects. The normalized flow properties increased with Knudsen number and are primarily affected by the interplay of compressibility and viscous dissipation effects. Flow recirculation occurred in the slip and transition regime, whereas it was absent in the free-molecular regime; moreover, the recirculation lengths decreased with rarefaction. The surface properties were found to increase with Knudsen number with peak magnitudes located on the upstream and frontal face of the step.}

abstract = {A new 2D parallel multispecies polyatomic particle-based hybrid flow solver is developed by coupling the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method with a novel Dynamic Collision Limiter (DCL) approach to solve multiscale transitional flows. The hybrid DSMC-DCL solver can solve nonequilibrium multiscale flows with length scales ranging from continuum to rarefied. The DCL method, developed in this work, dynamically assigns different number of collisions in cells, which is based on the local value of K-S parameter such that the number of collisions per time step is limited in near-equilibrium flow regions. Present hybrid solver uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test as the continuum breakdown parameter, based on which, the solution domain is decomposed into near-equilibrium and nonequilibrium flow regions. Direct Simulation Monte Carlo is used where nonequilibrium flow regions are encountered, while the DCL method is used where flow regions are found to be in near-equilibrium state. In this work, we have studied hypersonic flow of nitrogen over a blunt body with an aerospike and supersonic flow of argon through a micronozzle. The results obtained by the hybrid DSMC-DCL solver are compared and shown to agree well with the experimental data and with those obtained from DSMC, with significant savings in the computational cost.},

abstract = { A comprehensive review of all relevant experimental data was completed, including recent data for the drag coefficient for a sphere in supersonic and hypersonic flows. The primary characterization parameter included the relative Mach, Knudsen, and Reynolds numbers based on the relative velocity, the sphere diameter, and other parameters. This review of data showed that the previously proposed nexus at a Reynolds number below 45 was not strictly met, and it instead included a weak transonic bump, which was identified numerically for the first time with the present simulations. New continuum-gas and rarefied-gas simulations were conducted and were combined with the expanded experimental dataset to improve the quantitative description of the drag coefficient in this region. The results indicated that a quasi nexus bridges the rarefaction regime and the compressible flow regimes. The comprehensive dataset was then used to develop new empirical models for the drag coefficient that showed improved robustness and accuracy as compared to previous models. These models are limited by the critical Reynolds number associated with boundary-layer transition on the sphere, which was found to increase substantially with the sphere Mach number. }

	title={Nano-ADEPT aeroloads wind tunnel test},
	publisher={IEEE},
	pages={1-20},
	abstract={A wind tunnel test of the Adaptable Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) was conducted in April 2015 at the US Army&#39;s 7×10 Foot Wind Tunnel located at NASA Ames Research Center. Key geometric features of the fabric test article were a 0.7 m deployed base diameter, a 70° half-angle forebody cone angle, eight ribs, and a nose-to-base radius ratio of 0.7. The primary objective of this wind tunnel test was to obtain static deflected shape and pressure distributions while varying pretension at dynamic pressures and angles of attack relevant to entry conditions at Earth, Mars, and Venus. Other objectives included obtaining aerodynamic force and moment data and determining the presence and magnitude of any dynamic aeroelastic behavior (buzz/flutter) in the fabric trailing edge. All instrumentation systems worked as planned and a rich data set was obtained. This paper describes the test articles, instrumentation systems, data products, and test results. Four notable conclusions are drawn. First, test data support adopting a pre-tension lower bound of 10 lbf/in for Nano-ADEPT mission applications. Second, test results indicate that the fabric conditioning process needs to be reevaluated. Third, no flutter/buzz of the fabric was observed for any test condition and should also not occur at hypersonic speeds. Fourth, translating one of the gores caused ADEPT to generate lift without the need for a center of gravity offset. At hypersonic speeds, the lift generated by actuating ADEPT gores could be used for vehicle control.},

	title={Application of inflatable aeroshell structures for Entry Descent and Landing},
	publisher={IEEE},
	pages={1-10},
	note={ID: $cdi\_ieee\_primary\_6497412$},
	abstract={Future space missions will require improvements in the Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) phases of the mission architecture. The focus of this paper is to discuss recent advances in analysis, fabrication techniques, ground testing, and flight testing of a stacked torus Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) and its application to the future of EDL. The primary structure of a stacked torus HIAD consists of nested inflatable tori of increasing major diameter bonded and strapped to form a rigid structure after inflation. The underlying structure of the decelerator is covered with a flexible Thermal Protection System (TPS) capable of high heat flux. The inflatable aeroshell and TPS are packed around a centerbody within the launch fairing and deployed prior to atmospheric reentry. Recent fabrication of multiple HIADs between 3 and 6 meters has led to significant advances in process control and validation of the scalability of the technology. Progress has been made in generating and validating LS-DYNA FEA models to replicate flight loading in addition to analytical models of substructures. Coupon and component testing has improved the validation of modeling techniques and assumptions at the subsystem level. A ground testing campaign at the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Center (NFAC) wind tunnel at NASA Ames Research center generated substantial aerodynamic and loading data to validate full system modeling with comparable dynamic pressures to a hypersonic reentry. The Inflatable Reentry Vehicle - 3 (IRVE-3) sounding rocket flight test was conducted with NASA Langley Research Center in July 2012. The IRVE-3 mission verified the structural and thermal performance of the stacked torus configuration. Further development of the stacked torus configuration is currently being conducted to increase the thermal capability, deceleration loads, and understanding of the interactions and effects of constituent components. The results of this research have expanded the feasible flight envelope of stacked torus HIAD designs over a range of sizes, loading conditions, and heating.},

	title={A Rigid Mid-Lift-to-Drag Ratio Approach to Human Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing},
	publisher={NASA/Langley Research Center},
	address={Hampton},
	abstract={Current NASA Human Mars architectures require delivery of approximately 20 metric tons of cargo to the surface in a single landing. A proposed vehicle type for performing the entry, descent, and landing at Mars associated with this architecture is a rigid, enclosed, elongated lifting body shape that provides a higher lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) than a typical entry capsule, but lower than a typical winged entry vehicle (such as the Space Shuttle Orbiter). A rigid Mid-L/D shape has advantages for large mass Mars EDL, including loads management, range capability during entry, and human spaceflight heritage. Previous large mass Mars studies have focused more on symmetric and/or circular cross-section Mid-L/D shapes such as the ellipsled. More recent work has shown performance advantages for non-circular cross section shapes. This paper will describe efforts to design a rigid Mid-L/D entry vehicle for Mars which shows mass and performance improvements over previous Mid-L/D studies. The proposed concept, work to date and evolution, forward path, and suggested future strategy are described.}

	volume={58},

	pages={741-753},
	abstract={A novel rigid deployable aeroshell architecture has been developed, where rigid panels with a thermal protection system layer are connected between retractable ribs. Following origami principles, an optimal fold pattern is selected and imposed on the panels to ensure efficient flat stowage during launch and repeatable deployment. The design process includes minimizing the number of folds to reduce stacking height and maximizing the angles between each fold line to avoid an unfavorable aerothermodynamic response. The dynamic behavior of the optimal design is analyzed with the aid of a dynamic multibody analysis model. Results from the dynamic model show that the process of deployment is highly sensitive to panel geometry (especially panel thickness and hinge design). Robust, repeatable, and controllable deployment is most readily achieved with a small (but nonzero) panel thickness and selection of interpanel hinges, which allow a degree of over-rotation, avoiding a premature hard stop, which would otherwise prevent full deployment. Modeled results have been verified through experimental testing of a 0.4-m-diam scale model.},

	journal={AIAA SCITECH 2022 Forum},
	abstract={Cost is one of the biggest obstacles to sending humans to Mars. However, spacecraft costs are typically not taken into consideration until after the preliminary vehicle and mission concepts have been designed. Once costs have been estimated, managers and project teams often lack confidence that the final cost of the mission will match the preliminary estimates. The present work provides a robust methodology for using cost as a valid metric early in the design phase of future human Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) vehicles. This is done in three parts. First, state of the art parametric costing methods are applied to three Mars EDL vehicle concepts. Second, a methodology is presented which advances the state of the art in estimating the cost of space vehicles, specifically those used for EDL. This is done by automating portions of the cost estimation process, and integrating parametric cost tools with other systems analysis tools so that the effect of any change in vehicle or mission design on the mission cost can be determined more efficiently. Finally two of the primary parametric cost estimating tools used at NASA and in industry are tested in a blind validation study. To date, no such validation study has been published in the literature. In addition, standard parametric cost estimating methodologies and assumptions are compared with historical data and are modified to improve predictive capabilities.},

	abstract={This study explores the aerothermal behaviour of a rigid mechanically deployable aeroshell developed at Imperial College London for high-payload atmospheric entry missions. The multiphysics CFD software STAR-CCM+ is used to perform a Conjugate Heat Transfer analysis on the aeroshell’s faceted geometry. Results are presented for four different geometry models tested in air at Mach 5 with angles of attack α = 0°, 5° and 10°. The predicted surface heat transfer reveals areas of elevated heat loads at the ribs between facets and at the aeroshell shoulder, due to local boundary layer thinning. The increase in heat transfer at the ribs depends on the sharpness of the rib: more rounded shapes result in lower heat fluxes. Comparison with high-speed wind tunnel tests shows good agreement with experimental data. Stanton number and temperature profiles agree within 8\% and 2\% respectively. The discrepancies between experiments and simulations are largest at the sharp ribs of the aeroshell. The sources of error can be associated to three dimensional effects neglected in the heat flux derivations from temperature measurements as well as experimental uncertaintes.}

The derivation and nature of the equation in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates is presented in this chapter. The equations involve large number of terms, which makes them quite formidable to solve, both analytically and numerically. Nonetheless there has been some recent success in obtaining analytical solution of the Burnett equations, as discussed here. An order of magnitude analysis of the various terms reveals that the Burnett-order terms in the equations are of order Knudsen number square. A stability analysis of the equations for one-dimensional wave reveals the unstable nature of the equations.",
